# random-walk
A program I wrote for a Grade 10 assignment in CS class.

The assignment was: Imagine if you had a guy who was drunk and he was standing in the middle of a "road". Every x ms the guy moves left or right randomly by 1 space, and the goal is to simulate, on average, how many steps he takes before he walks off the road and... well the teacher didn't specify that part.

I made this really cool graphics version with a big easter egg in it; All you have to do to start it is to click the eye during the simulation.

Basically I leanred how to do the matrix rain effect, how to log stuff, a keypad system, and sprite creation/animation.

A definitely playable version at https://editor.p5js.org/freq/full/j5SlikyFd
